## Analysis
The business case for the Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu is reliant on whether there might be a demand for it year-round. The investors have requested an analysis of June and December's temperatures to determine year round potential. 

### Results

- June's average temperature runs around 77 degrees, while December's is closer to 72 degrees. This consistency indicates a likelihood that people will still be interested in surfing and buying ice cream during the winter months. 
- June has a higher potential temperature as is typical for summer, while December's lowest is about ten degrees cooler than June's. This is most likely due to weather patterns near the equator being more stable than on either extreme end. 
- The bell curve for June is significantly tighter than December's, making June statistically more reliable in temperature than December. 

### Summary
The temperature conditions required to open a surf and ice cream shop for the island of Oahu are very consistent. Opening a shop based solely on temperature data is very risky from a business standpoint. I would advise the following are taken into consideration as well:
- A wave analysis taking into account waters that do not meet recommended surf requirements as well as dangerous outliers. 
- A precipitation analysis similar to the following to determine the potential need for indoor seating regarding ice cream sales.
